# Sweetshop TDD

A sweetshop management system built using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for the Incubyte assessment.

## Overview

This project implements a sweetshop management system that allows users to search and purchase a sweet based on their needs. The application follows TDD methodology to ensure robust, well-tested code with comprehensive test coverage.

## Features

- **Add Sweets**: Add new sweet items to the inventory
- **Delete Sweets**: Remove sweet items from the inventory
- **View Sweets**: Display all available sweets in the shop
- **Restock Sweets**: Update the quantity of existing sweet items
- **Inventory Management**: Track sweet quantities and availability

## Technology Stack

- **Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Language**: Javascript
- **Testing Framework**: Jest

### Test Coverage

- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests for system workflows
- Test cases covering edge cases and error scenarios


### TDD Workflow

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Improve the code while keeping tests green

### Code Quality

- All features developed using TDD approach
- Comprehensive test suite
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Proper error handling and validation
